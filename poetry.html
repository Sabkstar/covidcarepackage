              <i>“THE PEACE OF WILD THINGS”</p></i>

            <p>BY WENDELL BERRY </p>
           <p>
              When despair for the world grows in me
              and I wake in the night at the least sound
              in fear of what my life and my children’s lives might be,
            <br>
            I go and lie down where the wood drake
            rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.
            <br>
            I come into the peace of wild things
            who do not tax their lives with forethought
            of grief. I come into the presence of still water. </br>
            <br>
            And I feel above me the day-blind stars
            waiting with their light. For a time
            I rest in the grace of the world, and am free.</br>
            <br>

                  <p> “ It screams at jet-engine volume that we are interdependent not only with each other but also with the entire ecology of the earth.” <em>-N. Katherine Hayles </em> </p>
                  <!-- Webpage response to reading -->
                  <p> One of the ways to take care of oneself is slow and down, rest, wash one's hands and heal. To share with other's such an experience is also needed as we are children of the Earth. </p>
